## Difficulties

Mostly understanding, I started complicating it. Later it went smoothly.

## Exercise:  Maximum Difference in an Array

The maximum difference between elements in some array, a, is defined as the largest difference between any a[i] and a[j] where i < j and a[i] < a[j]. For example, ifa = [4, 1, 2, 3], the maximum difference would be a[3] — a[1] = 3 — 1 = 2 because this is the largest difference between any two elements satisfying the aforementioned
criteria.

Complete the maXDifference function in the editor below. It has 1 parameter: an array of integers, a. It must return an integer denoting the maximum difference
between any pair of elements in a; if no such number exists (e.g., ifa is in descending order and all a[j] < a[i]), return —1 instead.

#### Input Format

Locked stub code in the editor reads the following input from stdin and passes it to the function:

The first line contains a single integer, n, denoting the number of elements in array a.

Each line i ofthe n subsequent lines (where 0 s i < n) contains a single integer describing element a[i].

#### Output Format

The function must return an integer denoting the maximum difference in a. This is printed to stdout by locked stub code in the editor.
